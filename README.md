- Tasks can be marked as done and removed. Also all existing tasks can be wiped at once.
- Tasks are kept even when changing workspaces

This extension contributes the following commands to the Command palette.

- _Daily Tasks: Focus on List View_ (`tasks.list.focus`): Opens and focuses the task list
